## Subject Presentation

In the following project, we aim to create an image classifier with Tensorflow by implementing a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify chest x-ray images with COVID 19 infection and images of normal cases.

The dataset contains chest x-ray images from both groups. We will carry out the entire project on the Google Colab environment.

### Project's Stages
This project will be processed according to the following steps: 

- Data Preparation (visualization preprocessing and Augmentation)

- Model Construction (Building a CNN, compiling, training and performance evaluation)

- Prediction on New Data

## Technologies
* Notebook (Jupyter/Google Colab)
* Python 
* Tensorflow
